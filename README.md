# KBMixer
Written in C# using .NET, KBMixer allows you to finely tune the audio levels of individual applications on your Windows device using specified global keyboard hotkeys and your mouse scroll wheel without needing to focus a specific volume mixer application.

While `NirSoft's Volumouse` accomplished this goal, it is both outdated and inconsistent in my experience. After reimaging my PC with a fresh copy of Windows 11, I haven't been able to get it working ever since- even when restoring configuration from a backup. Thus, the need for a modern and refined alternative arose.

Personally, this application allows me to control the individual volumes of the game I'm currently playing, Discord, and Chrome on the fly. This way, I don't ever have to navigate menus to adjust volume which is especially useful mid-game.
